# Pharmaceutical-Sales-prediction-across-multiple-stores
This is a project for a forecast sales in all Rossemann Pharmaceuticals stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. 
The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.
The goal is to build an end to end product that delivers this prediction
